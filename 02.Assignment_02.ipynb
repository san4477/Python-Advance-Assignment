    "Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "Ans: A Python class is like an outline/blueprint/mold for creating a new object. An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or \n",
    "change while working through the code. Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is \n",
    "initiated from scratch Whereas in Python, Modules are simply files with the . py extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python \n",
    "Program. In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions/Classes\n",
    "that you want to include in your application."

    "Q2. How do you make instances and classes?\n",
